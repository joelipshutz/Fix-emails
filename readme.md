This is my first attempt at a web app using an LLM.

The purpose of this project was to
  1. Familiarize myself w langchain and openai API
  2. Have fun :)

  To get environment started on terminal:
    1. cd to project folder
    2. initialize streamlit shell -> pipenv shell
    3. streamlit run myfile.py

    Also, you need streamlit and xcode installed. See documentation here
